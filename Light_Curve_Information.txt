Description of the observations:


We acquired ground-based time-series follow-up photometry of a full transit of TOI-736.02 on UTC 2019 June 11, with two separate Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) 1.0 m telescopes \citep{Brown:2013} at Siding Spring Observatory. We used the {\tt TESS Transit Finder}, which is a customized version of the {\tt Tapir} software package \citep{Jensen:2013}, to schedule photometric time-series follow-up observations. The $4096\times4096$ LCO SINISTRO camera has an image scale of 0$\farcs$389 pixel$^{-1}$ resulting in a $26\arcmin\times26\arcmin$ field of view. One observation in Sloan i$\prime$ band lasted 192 minutes, using 100 second exposure times (92 images). The other observation in Bessel-I band lasted 99 minutes, using 60 second exposures (66 images). The images were calibrated by the standard LCO BANZAI pipeline and the photometric data were extracted using the {\tt AstroImageJ} ({\tt AIJ} software package \citep{Collins:2017}. In both datasets, the target star light curve shows a clear transit detection in a 3.89$\arcs$ radius aperture. The nearest known Gaia DR2 star is $15\arcs$ from TOI-736. The FWHM of the target and nearby stars in the Sloan i$\prime$ observation is $\sim1\farcs4$, so the follow-up aperture is negligibly contaminated by neighboring faint Gaia DR2 stars. The transit signal can be reliably detected with apertures having a radius as small as $1\farcs95$; systematic effects start to dominate the light curve for smaller apertures. We also acquired ground-based time-series follow-up photometry of a full transit of TOI-736.01 on UTC 2019 June 16 from an LCO 1.0 m telescope at the South Africa Astronomical Observatory. The 169 minute observation in Bessel-I band used 60 second exposure times resulting in 114 images. The images were calibrated by the same process described above. The target star has a FWHM of 2.21$\arcs$ and the light curve shows a clear transit detection in a 3.89$\arcs$ radius aperture, indicating that both of the observed planet candidates are transiting the same star.




Analysis


LCO transit light curves were fit to a \texttt{BATMAN} \citep{Kreidberg2015} model multiplied by a linear airmass correction model to account for the out-of-transit baseline. MCMC models were run using \textit{emcee} \citep{Foreman-Mackey2013}. The two observations of NLTT 26088b were modeled jointly by fitting for different baselines with a joint transit depth (R$_{\rm{p}}$/R$_{*}$) and mid-transit time (T0). We model only the transit depths and mid-transit times, leaving all other physical parameters set to those derived from the TESS light curve. Limb darkening was calculated using \texttt{LDTK} \citep{Parviainen2015} based on the stellar parameters in this work. We find that the transit parameters are consistent with those calculated from the TESS light curves.

The best-fit linear function of airmass has been divided out of the plotted light curve data. \textit{Bottom:} Residuals to the fit, normalized by the errors (i.e., (data$_{i}$-model$_{i}$)/\rm{\sigma_i}).

\textit{Top:} Ground-based photometry of NLTT 26088b’s transit from our two LCO 1 m observations along with the best-fit transit model (black line) and 1$\sigma$ uncertainties (red region). The two different sets of observations are differentiated as blue and gray circles with errorbars. A best-fit linear function of airmass has been divided out of each light curve. \textit{Bottom:} Residuals to the fit, normalized by the errors (i.e., (data$_{i}$-model$_{i}$)/\rm{\sigma_i}).
